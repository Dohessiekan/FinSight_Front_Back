# Enhanced AdviceScreen - Financial Analysis-Based Advice

## 🎯 Overview
The AdviceScreen has been completely enhanced to provide **personalized financial advice** based on the user's actual SMS financial analysis data, rather than generic static advice.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Personalized Financial Advice**
- **Smart Spending Analysis**: Compares money sent vs received
- **Transaction Frequency Monitoring**: Tracks high-activity patterns
- **Balance Optimization**: Provides advice based on current account balance
- **Airtime/Data Spending**: Suggests cost optimization for communication expenses
- **Security Alerts**: Warns about suspicious transactions detected in SMS analysis

### 2. **Real-Time Data Integration**
- Fetches user's financial summary from Firebase (`financialSummary` field)
- Integrates with fraud alerts collection for security advice
- Uses actual transaction counts, amounts, and patterns
- Updates advice when financial data changes

### 3. **Dynamic UI Components**
- **Priority Badges**: Visual indicators for advice urgency (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Action Buttons**: Save useful advice to favorites
- **Refresh Functionality**: Update advice based on latest financial data
- **Analysis Banner**: Shows when advice is based on SMS analysis

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
```javascript
// Primary: User's Financial Summary
const summary = userDoc.data().financialSummary;
// Fields: transactions_count, total_sent, total_received, 
//         total_withdrawn, total_airtime, latest_balance

// Secondary: Fraud Alerts for Security
const alertsRef = collection(db, 'users', user.uid, 'fraudAlerts');
```

### Advice Generation Logic
1. **Spending Pattern Analysis**
   - If `totalSent > totalReceived`: Show spending control advice
   - If `totalReceived > totalSent`: Show surplus saving advice

2. **Transaction Volume Analysis**
   - If `transactionCount > 30`: Show monitoring advice

3. **Balance-Based Advice**
   - If `balance < 50,000 RWF`: Emergency fund advice (HIGH priority)
   - If `balance > 500,000 RWF`: Investment opportunity advice

4. **Communication Costs**
   - If `totalAirtime > 20,000 RWF`: Bundle optimization advice

5. **Security Assessment**
   - If `suspiciousTransactions > 0`: Security alert (CRITICAL priority)
   - Else: Good security practices confirmation
