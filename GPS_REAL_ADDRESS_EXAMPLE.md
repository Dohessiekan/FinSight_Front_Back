## 🗺️ **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Ultra-High Precision GPS**
```
🛰️ Phase 1: Initializing GPS satellite connection...
✅ Initial GPS lock: ±15.2m
🎯 Phase 2: Optimizing satellite constellation lock...
📡 Reading 1/6: Acquiring satellite data...
🎯 New best accuracy: ±8.1m
📡 Reading 2/6: Acquiring satellite data...
🎯 New best accuracy: ±4.5m
📡 Reading 3/6: Acquiring satellite data...
🎯 New best accuracy: ±3.2m
🔬 Phase 3: Applying coordinate averaging for sub-meter precision...
🎯 ENHANCED: Coordinate averaging applied - Final accuracy: ±2.2m
```

### **Step 2: Reverse Geocoding**
```
🌍 Getting real location address...
📍 Real Address: 123 KN 5 Road, Nyarugenge, Kigali, Rwanda
🏆 FINAL RESULT: STREET_LEVEL accuracy achieved!
🏢 You can now see individual buildings and street addresses!
```

### **Step 3: Fraud Alert with Real Address**
```
🚨 Creating fraud alert for manual analysis result...
🌍 Admin will see: 123 KN 5 Road, Nyarugenge, Kigali, Rwanda
📍 Location: Kigali, Nyarugenge, Rwanda
🗺️ ALERT WILL BE VISIBLE ON MAP with REAL ADDRESS: 123 KN 5 Road, Nyarugenge, Kigali, Rwanda
