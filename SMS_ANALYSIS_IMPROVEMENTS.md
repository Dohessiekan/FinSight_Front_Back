# SMS Financial Analysis Improvements

## Changes Made to Address Balance and Transaction Logic Issues

### 1. **Latest Balance Extraction (API - main.py)**

**Problem**: Balance was taken from the last record, not necessarily the most recent transaction.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `summarize()` function to sort transactions by date
- Extract balance from the most recent transaction chronologically
- If no date available, use the last processed message with a balance

```python
# Get latest balance from the most recent transaction (by date, then by position)
latest_balance = None
if not df['balance'].dropna().empty:
    df_with_balance = df[df['balance'].notna()].copy()
    if not df_with_balance['date'].isnull().all():
        df_with_balance = df_with_balance.sort_values(['date'], ascending=False, na_position='last')
    latest_balance = float(df_with_balance['balance'].iloc[0])
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Transaction Detection (API - main.py)**

**Problem**: Limited transaction type detection missing many payment messages.

**Solution**: 
- Expanded `parse_sms()` function with comprehensive patterns
- Added keyword-based detection for different transaction types
- More inclusive patterns for sent, received, withdrawn, and airtime transactions

**New Keywords Covered**:
- **Sent**: sent, transferred, paid, payment to, transfer to, sent to, paid to
- **Received**: received, credited, deposit, salary, refund
- **Withdrawal**: withdrawn, withdraw, cash, atm
- **Airtime**: airtime, bundle, bought airtime/bundle

### 3. **Enhanced Balance Pattern Matching (API - main.py)**

**Problem**: Limited balance extraction patterns.

**Solution**: Added more balance patterns:
```python
balance_patterns = [
    r'new\s+balance[:\s]*(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
    r'balance[:\s]*(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
    r'current\s+balance[:\s]*(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
    r'your\s+balance\s+is\s+(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
    r'balance\s+is\s+now\s+(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
    r'remaining\s+balance[:\s]*(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)\s*rwf',
]
```

### 4. **Improved Mobile App Filtering (api.js)**

**Problem**: App filtering was too restrictive, missing many transaction messages.

**Solution**: 
- Made filtering much more comprehensive in `analyzeCurrentMonthSMS()`
- Added multiple categories of financial keywords
- Included pattern matching for amounts and provider names

**New Filtering Categories**:
- Core financial indicators (rwf, balance, transaction)
- Payment keywords (payment, paid, transfer, sent, received, etc.)
- Banking keywords (withdraw, airtime, momo, bank, atm, account)
- Provider keywords (mtn, airtel, tigo, bk, equity, etc.)
- Amount patterns (regex for RWF amounts)
- Balance information patterns
- General money-related terms

### 5. **Better Transaction Counting (API - main.py)**

**Problem**: Inconsistent transaction counting logic.

**Solution**:
- `transactions_count`: All processed messages (shows total SMS analyzed)
- `amount_transactions_count`: Only messages with extractable amounts (actual financial transactions)
- Filter out zero amounts and 'other' types for financial calculations

### 6. **Enhanced Dashboard Display (DashboardScreen.js)**

**Problem**: Limited display of transaction information.

**Solution**:
- Show both total messages and messages with amounts
- Display withdrawn and airtime amounts when available
- Better loading and error messages
- Monthly breakdown display when available

### 7. **Improved Test Coverage (test_predict_sms.py)**

**Problem**: Limited test cases.

**Solution**: Added diverse SMS examples including:
- Different balance formats
- Various transaction types
- Different wording patterns
- Edge cases

## Expected Results

With these improvements:

1. **Balance**: Will show the balance from your most recent transaction
2. **Transaction Count**: Will count all payment-related messages, not just specific formats
3. **Amount Accuracy**: Better extraction of financial amounts from diverse SMS formats
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Catches more transaction types and banking messages

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
cd FinSightApp/API
python test_predict_sms.py
```

The API should now:
- Process more diverse transaction messages
- Extract the latest balance correctly
- Provide more accurate financial summaries
- Show logical transaction counts and amounts
