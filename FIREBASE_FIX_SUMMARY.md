## 🚀 Next Steps to Fix Your Issue

### Step 1: Test Mobile App Authentication
1. Open your mobile app
2. Go to the Messages screen
3. Tap the new **Debug** button (next to Scan Month)
4. Check if Firebase connection test passes

### Step 2: Force Save Test Messages
If authentication works, try scanning messages again:
1. Tap "Scan Month" button
2. Watch the console logs for detailed error messages
3. Look for "✅ Successfully saved message to Firebase" messages

### Step 3: Check Web Dashboard
1. Open web dashboard at `http://localhost:3001` (or wherever it's running)
2. Check the debug information panel
3. Look for your user ID in the dropdown
4. Verify messages appear

### Step 4: Manual Debugging
If issues persist, the new debug tools will show:
- Firebase authentication status
- Number of users found
- Message count per user
- Detailed error messages

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "User not authenticated"
**Solution**: Check if user is signed in properly in the mobile app

### Issue 2: "No users found"
**Solution**: User needs to be authenticated and have saved at least one message

### Issue 3: "Messages not appearing in web dashboard"
**Solution**: Check if `monthYear` field is properly set and current month filter is correct

### Issue 4: "Firebase connection failed"
**Solution**: Verify Firebase configuration and internet connection

When you scan messages now, you'll see detailed logs like:
```
